# Code for semester project
### Description of data
Source: https://elifesciences.org/articles/35962#content and https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA412631
Who: HIVE Cohort for respiratory virus surveillance
What: Flu sequences from 200 people in a test-negative study
Where: JT McCrone et al. at UMich
When: 2010-2015
Why: We know flu evolution is evolutionarily stochastic within-host but deterministic globally. Maybe the answer lies between-host?

Aims:
Evolution w/in hosts through serial time points
Evolution b/w hosts through household pairing

### Stage of data
Raw SRA reads in need of QC and alignment
